## üìú Abstract

Elaina-SSRF-Probe is not merely a script; it is a sophisticated framework engineered for the systematic identification, analysis, and validation of Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities. Moving beyond simple payload injection, SSRF-Probe employs a synergistic blend of traditional security testing, advanced machine learning for intelligent response analysis, and a comprehensive arsenal of Web Application Firewall (WAF) bypass techniques. The framework is designed to emulate a human expert's thought process, combining rapid discovery with deep, contextual analysis to uncover even the most subtly concealed SSRF flaws in modern web applications and cloud environments.

---

## üöÄ Key Features

### üîç Comprehensive Payload Arsenal
- **Cloud Metadata Targets**: Pre-configured payloads for AWS (`169.254.169.254`), GCP (`metadata.google.internal`), Azure (`100.100.100.200`), and AliCloud.
- **Internal Network Services**: Probes for common internal services (Redis, Elasticsearch, databases, etc.).
- **Local File Access**: `file://` protocol payloads for potential Local File Inclusion (LFI) via SSRF.
- **IPv6 & Obfuscation**: Support for IPv6 addresses and various IP format obfuscations (decimal, octal, hexadecimal).

### üõ°Ô∏è Advanced WAF Evasion
- **Multi-Layered Bypass**: Over 20 distinct obfuscation techniques, including URL encoding, null byte injection, comment insertion, and header manipulation.
- **Intelligent Profiling**: Automatically profiles target WAFs (Cloudflare, Akamai, ModSecurity) and selects the most effective bypass strategies.
- **Traffic Shaping**: Implements human-like request patterns, random delays, and User-Agent rotation to evade behavioral detection.

### üß† Intelligent Analysis Engine
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Utilizes an ensemble of models (Naive Bayes, Random Forest, MLP, SVM, etc.) to analyze server responses, significantly reducing false positives.
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Establishes baseline response metrics (time, size) and flags anomalies that might indicate a successful SSRF, even without explicit fingerprints.
- **Contextual Awareness**: Employs a headless browser (via Playwright) for deep contextual analysis, understanding application flow to identify high-value input vectors.

### üåê Blind SSRF Detection
- **Integrated Callback Servers**: Features built-in DNS and HTTP servers to reliably detect out-of-band (blind) SSRF vulnerabilities.
- **Unique Identifiers**: Generates unique, non-colliding callback URLs for each test, ensuring accurate correlation.

### üéØ Reinforcement Learning (Optional)
- **Adaptive Agent**: An optional Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent can be trained to learn the optimal sequence of payloads and bypass techniques for a specific target.
- **Fine-Tuning**: The agent can be fine-tuned for specific environments, improving its success rate over time.

### üìà Professional Reporting & Integration
- **Interactive HTML Reports**: Generates visually rich, interactive reports with charts, graphs, and sortable tables using Plotly and Jinja2.
- **Multi-Format Export**: Supports exporting results to JSON, CSV, XML, and plain text for seamless integration into various workflows.
- **Platform Integration**: Native support for pushing findings to JIRA, DefectDojo, and sending notifications to Slack.

### üìä Reporting
- The true power of SSRF-Probe lies in its ability to communicate findings effectively. The interactive HTML report is a cornerstone of this capability.
Interactive HTML Report

<p align="center">
<img src="https://pin.it/2RsHXYt8p" alt="banner" width="800">
</p>

## The report provides:
- Executive Dashboard: High-level metrics including total vulnerabilities, confidence distribution, and detected OS.
- Detailed Findings Table: A sortable, filterable table listing each vulnerability with its URL, parameter, payload, and confidence score.
- Visual Analytics: Interactive charts (using Plotly) showing vulnerability distribution by endpoint, payload type, and detected operating system.
- Evidence & PoC: For each finding, the report provides clear evidence snippets from the server response and a reproducible curl command for validation.
- Risk Assessment: Each vulnerability is assigned a risk level (Critical, High, Medium, Low) based on the type of data accessed and exploitation potential.
## üß† Technical Deep Dive
- Payload Management & WAF Bypass
- The PayloadManager class is the heart of the attack vector generation. It doesn't just store a list of payloads; it manages a dynamic ecosystem of attack techniques.
- Core Payloads: A comprehensive list targeting known-sensitive resources.
- Bypass Techniques: A collection of lambda functions, each representing a unique obfuscation method. For example:
- url_encode: Standard URL encoding.
- add_null_byte: Appends a %00 to terminate strings prematurely.
- ipv6_bypass: Converts IPv4 addresses to their IPv6 equivalent (::ffff:169.254.169.254).
- override_headers: Attempts to inject headers like X-Forwarded-Host.
- Dynamic Generation: The generate_waf_bypass_payloads method applies all relevant bypass techniques to a base payload, creating a large set of variations to test against a WAF.
- # The Machine Learning Pipeline
- The framework's intelligence comes from its ML pipeline, orchestrated by the MLModelManager.
- Vectorization: The TfidfVectorizer converts raw response text into a matrix of TF-IDF features.
- Label Encoding: Categorical labels (e.g., 'normal', 'ssrf', 'error') are converted into numerical form.
- Model Ensemble: Multiple scikit-learn models are trained on a labeled dataset of normal, SSRF, and error responses. This ensemble approach provides robustness.
- Prediction: When a new response is received, it's transformed by the same vectorizer and fed to all trained models. The probabilities from each model are -- - - averaged to produce a final confidence score for each class.
- Persistence: Trained models, vectorizers, and encoders are serialized using pickle and can be saved/loaded, allowing the framework to learn from new data over time.
- # Reinforcement Learning Agent
- For advanced users and hardened targets, the RLAgent provides a way to optimize the attack process.
- Environment (RLEnvironment): Models the SSRF problem as a Markov Decision Process.
- State Space (observation_space): A 10-dimensional vector representing features of the last response (status code, time, size, content indicators).
- Action Space (action_space): A discrete space representing the choice of a specific payload and bypass technique combination.
- Reward Function: A carefully crafted function that rewards actions leading to high-confidence SSRF discoveries (e.g., finding cloud metadata) and penalizes - # failures or WAF blocks.
- Agent (PPO): Uses the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm from stable-baselines3. It learns a policy that maps states (observations) to actions (payload choices) to maximize the cumulative reward.
- Training: The agent can be trained from scratch or, more effectively, fine-tuned from a pre-trained base model on a specific target to adapt to its unique defenses.
### üìù Payload Customization

While SSRF-Probe comes with a comprehensive set of payloads, you can easily extend it.
Create a custom JSON file (e.g., my_payloads.json):

```
{
  "ssrf_payloads": [
    "http://internal-dashboard.company.com/admin",
    "https://metadata.internal.company.com/v1/instance"
  ],
  "waf_bypass_techniques": [
    "custom_technique_1",
    "custom_technique_2"
  ]
}
```

Then, reference it during the scan:
```
python elaina.py scan -u https://target.com --payloads my_payloads.json
```
- Note: For custom WAF bypass techniques, you must also implement the corresponding lambda function within the PayloadManager class in the source code.
